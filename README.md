A simple Python-based Digital Clock built using Tkinter. It displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format along with AM/PM and the full date. The clock updates every second using the strftime function. A lightweight GUI project ideal for beginners exploring Tkinter and real-time updates.
A clean, centered window opens with a bright yellow background.
The time is displayed in large, bold Calibri font, making it look like a real digital clock.
